<p>License Version <license/></p>
<p>This app provides <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a> charts access for AvNav</p>
<p>When you start assigning licenses from o-charts to this system registered with avocharts you will <b>not be able to share this licenses with OpenCPN</b> on the same device.<br/>
    If you later on would like to use the same chart with OpenCPN on this device you will need a second license.<br/>
    The same way avocharts cannot use the license you already assigned to OpenCPN on this device.<br/>
    You will not be able to later on move a license from avocharts to openCPN.</p>
<p>Charts are licensed under the conditions and terms of the <a href="https://o-charts.org/manuals/conditions.php">o-charts license</a>.</p>
<p><b>Important</b><br/>
    You are running a debug version of avocharts. <br/>
    This version is intended for testing only.
    Charts that you assign to your device with this version cannot be used later on with a release or beta version.<br/>
    So if you would like to use the same charts later with a release version you would need a new license.
    For a workaround refer to the <a href="https://www.wellenvogel.net/software/avnav/docs/hints/ochartsng.html?lang=en#h3:BetaandReleaseVersions">documentation</a>.
